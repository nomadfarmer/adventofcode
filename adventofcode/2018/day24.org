[2018-12-24 Mon 22:05] Getting started in earnest.  I spent a few
minutes last night skimming the specs and outlining the Group class,
but spent my time helping a friend with day 23 and finding problems
with my day 23 solution.

Spent a few minutes considering one massive regex to get all info at
once, but it's nontrivial and 3 regexes will be much more readable.

Specs: We'll simulate a fight between an immune system and an
infection Each side has several <groups>.  groups made of <units>,
units in the same group have the same <hp>, <attack damage>, <attack
type>, <initiative>, and possibly <weaknesses> and <immunities>

From that we can calculate group <effective power>: 
number of units * damage

Turns in combat go in two phases... target selection and attack Targe
selection phase: 
  From highest to lowest effective power:
    choose opponent to whom this group will do the most damage 
    (accounting for immunity and weaknesses)
    (can't choose an opponent that was already chosen)
    Ties for most damage possible go to:
        1. higher effective power
        2. higher initiative.
    No damage possible -> don't choose target
attack phase:
    highest to lowest initiative:
    deal damage equal to effective power
    can't damage groups immune to our attack
    deal double damage to groups weak to our attack

    defending groups only lose whole units.
    E.G. 10 damage done to a group with 3 hp per unit, the 
    defender loses 3 units, the extra hp is wasted.

Back at it. I'm parsing input, I think (about to double check
accuracy), but I took a detour because day 25 dropped and it looked
like more fun.

I can't finish day 25 part 2 until I have both stars for this day,
though.
