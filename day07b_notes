Part B thoughts:

We have a list of tasks that take different amounts of time. We have 5
available workers.

How do we calculate how long it will take to accomplish everything?

I'm tempted to write classes. A 'task engine' and a worker class.

task engine would have methods to claim the next available task and to
mark tasks as completed.

worker class would keep track of what task a worker is doing and when
they are free
